Phase 5 notes:
The Client is a console-based program

\. Flip the board (write it in both orientaiotns)

We will build 3 user interfaces: REPLs Read Eval Print Loops
The REPLs are the structure in which the UIs live
(Classes that implement a "User Interface" and it's respective REPL)
//PET SHOP REPL HAS MAIN TERMINAL LOOP
\. Prelogin UI 
\. Post Loign UI
\. Gameplay UI (print out the board)

We will have to change the colors of what we're outputting to the terminal
***Pre calls post calls gameplay calls pre***

Write UNIT tests for your server facade first 

Class ServerFacade will be part of the Client

Look at GET and PostExample.java for Serverfacade

***Make HEAVY use of ServerFacade in Pet Shop*** And then write the tests

//Later on, look up terminal control codes

//Remember how to read from standard In
